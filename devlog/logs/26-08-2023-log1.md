## Work of the day
After looking at different projects and rust resources, I had a hard time deciding on what project to start on. This is an excuse to use a little bit of rust I learned nd also use a game engine.

### Project Set up

The project was set up following a bevy tutorial. The link can be found below. It is a simple project setup with cargo and a bevy dependency. The code corresponds to the one of the tutorial github with some changes; No character is present.

### Things Learned
- The toml config has the opt-level values so as to have faster compile times during development. The drawback is that the first compile is reeeealy slow.
- The video tutorial presents how bevy is architectured around the principle of ECS and as such we can implement a small camera with that way of working.
