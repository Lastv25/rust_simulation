## Work of the day
Adding textures and setting the inspector egui

## Things Learned
-  For texture or resources bevy will by default search for a folder stored in the root path called assets
- Looking at the bevy implementation and documentation gave me a better Idea of whet ECS is and how it works.
- The inspector egui plugin is really usefull ^^
